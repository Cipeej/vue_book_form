### Vue book form

This project acts as a book managing app, where the user can add new books to the collection, and update or delete them.
It consists of a Vue front-end part and a quick and "fake" json-server backend.

### Starting front-end
- Run the command `npm run serve` with a terminal at project root
- Project utilises localhost:8080 port

### Starting back-end
- To start json-server, use the command `json-server booksData.json` at project root
- json-server utilises localhost:3000 port
